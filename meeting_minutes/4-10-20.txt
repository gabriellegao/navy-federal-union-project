New approach:
1. Load NFCU social media posts: dataset
2. Label each post in dataset as positive, negative, neutral
	-Use the following tools:
		-IBM Watson
		-TextBlob
		-Airline Classifier
	-Creates column label in dataset with label=1 as positive, 0 as neutral, -1 as negative
	-Creates variables positive_dataset, negative_dataset, neutral_dataset
2. Topic Mining (LDA)
	-on whole dataset, positive_dataset, negative_dataset, neutral_dataset
	-Create variables dataset_topics, positive_topics, negative_topics, neutral_topics
3. Topic Mining Within Clusters
	-Use K-Means to generate clusters for the whole dataset, positive_dataset, negative_dataset, neutral_dataset
		-Create variables dataset_clusters, positive_clusters, negative_clusters, neutral_clusters
	-Perform LDA on each cluster
		-Create variables dataset_cluster_topics, positive_cluster_topics, negative_cluster_topics, neutral_cluster_topics
	-Create variable useful_topics
		-From  dataset_topics, positive_topics, negative_topics, neutral_topics,
		       dataset_cluster_topics, positive_cluster_topics, negative_cluster_topics, neutral_cluster_topics
	-Name each useful topic and create variable useful_topic_names
4. Topic Classifiers
	-Train topic classifiers to determine whether a post is related to each of the topics in useful_topics
5. Actionability Filter
	-Label posts as actionable if it relates to any relevant topic (if any Topic Classifier returns 1)
6. Sentiment Classifier
	-Use actionability filter to label posts as actionable or non-actionable
	-Select a sample of actionable posts for which the polarity distribution is representative of the whole dataset
	-Manually label the sample of actionable posts as positive, negative or neutral
	-All non-actionable posts should automatically be labeled neutral
	-Train a classifier on the manually labeled sample
	-Use the classifier to label the rest of the dataset as positive, negative, neutral
	-Perform 2, 3, 4, 5 again with the newly labeled dataset to improve results of topic mining, topic classifiers, and actionability filter
7. Result: a sentiment classifier that will only extract posts that are relevant to NFCU's brand image in either a positive or a negative way
	-Improved sentiment classifier can now be used to extract more specific topics that are relevant to NFCU

New approach:
1. Label each post in dataset as positive, negative, neutral
	-Use the following tools: IBM Watson, TextBlob, Airline Classifier
2. Topic Mining (LDA)
	-Run on whole dataset as well as the subsets of positive posts, negative posts and neutral posts
3. Topic Mining Within Clusters
	-Use K-Means to generate clusters of posts within whole dataset as well as clusters of posts within positive posts, negative posts and neutral posts
4. List useful topics produced by 2 & 3 and name them
5. Topic Classifiers
	-Train topic classifiers to determine whether a post is related to each of the topics in 4
5. Actionability Filter
	-Label posts as actionable if it relates to any relevant topic (if any Topic Classifier returns 1)
6. Sentiment Classifier
	-Use actionability filter to label posts as actionable or non-actionable
	-Select a sample of actionable posts for which the polarity distribution is representative of the whole dataset
	-Manually label the sample of actionable posts as positive, negative or neutral
	-All non-actionable posts should automatically be labeled neutral
	-Train a classifier on the manually labeled sample
	-Use the classifier to label the rest of the dataset as positive, negative, neutral
	-Perform 2, 3, 4, 5 again with the newly labeled dataset to improve results of topic mining, topic classifiers, and actionability filter
7. Result: a sentiment classifier that will only extract posts that are relevant to NFCU's brand image in either a positive or a negative way
	-Improved sentiment classifier can now be used to extract more specific topics that are relevant to NFCU

-Initial approach:
	-Topic Mining (LDA or LSA) -> Topics
	-Topics -> Topic Classifier
		-Name the topics we think will be useful
		-Manually label a chunk of the data by the useful topics to train a supervised topic classifier
	-Supervised Sentiment Classifier
		-Manually label a chunk of the data as positive, negative, neutral
	-Topic Classifier + Supervised Sentiment Classifier -> Topic-Based Sentiment Classifier

-Second approach:
	-Supervised Sentiment Classifier
		-Manually label a chunk of the data as positive, negative, neutral
	-Perform Topic Mining (LDA) -> Topics
		-on all data, positive, negative, neutral
		-on all data, positive, negative, neutral after K-means clustering
		-take only the useful looking topics extracted by these methods
	-Topics -> Topic Classifier
		-Manually label a chunk of the data by the useful topics to train a supervised topic classifier
	-Topic Classifier + Supervised Sentiment Classifier -> Topic-Based Sentiment Classifier

Topic Mining Topic Classifiers => Aspect Based Sentiment
	-LDA -> Topics -> Topic Classifiers + Sentiment Analysis -> Topic Based Sentiment
-LDA wasn't working so well, so moved to approach:
	-Sentiment Analysis -> LDA within positive and negative groups -> Topics -> Topic Classifiers -> Topic Based Sentiment
-New approach?
	-Topic Classifiers as Actionability Filter -> Sentiment Analysis on Actionable Posts -> LDA within positive and negative actionable posts -> Update Topic Classifiers and repeat
	-Allows for trend tracking of topics over time via the topic classifiers
	-Allows for tracking sentiment over time, both overall and by topic
