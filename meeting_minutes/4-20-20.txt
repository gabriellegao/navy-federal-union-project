In response to the presentation presenting our mid-point findings 3 days prior, Ryan mentioned to us that the conflict between small and big picture was largely the result of several of the employees on the call holding more customer service oriented positions while others were moreso marketing employees, so they were each pushing for the aspects of our research that would most benefit them. He said that the idea of actionability was going to be more practical and approachable at the end of the day, and that it could be applied to areas beyond customer service such as survey results. Ryan told us that after speaking with some of the employees on the call after the meeting and explaining this, he wanted us to stick with the idea of actionability and do our trend analysis within that scope.
