sentiment classifier and clustering algorithm to identify praise and criticism tweets
	percent of praise cluster marked postiive by sentiment classifier?
	percent marked negative?
actionability model
	length of post?
	hand label classifier
	doesn't have to be very scientific
trends
	of the praiseworthy tweets, how many mention credit cards? mortgages? accounts?
how should we visualize this information?

possible approach:
  sentiment classifier to divide tweets into positive and negative
  cluster positive tweets, cluster negative tweets
  filter words in each cluster
	 valid english words with at least a certain association with credit union related words (credit, mortgage, etc)
	  filter out positive/negative words
